    <string name="intro">This is a small example where we\'re trying to increment the counter 50 times across 2 threads which should provide us with 100 as a result. Let\'s see the results in thread safe and thread unsafe methods.  If you press, thread-unsafe counter, the counter is of type Int, which when accessed by two threads simultaneously might provide same value. If you press, thread-safe counter, the counter is of type Atomic Int which uses a volatile int which makes it thread safe..</string>
